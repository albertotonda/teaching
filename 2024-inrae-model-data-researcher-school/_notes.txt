Discorso (80')
========
- what is Machine Learning?
	optimization over model, same model can reproduce a great variety of behaviors; optimize internal parameters based on data, to get the best behavior
	how do you optimize? SUPERVISED, based on examples that already contain the correct answer; UNSUPERVISED, make up some metric to optimize
	TABULAR DATA vs STRUCTURED data
	
- general issues	
	mostly used for PREDICTIVE models, because most ML models are hard to interpret; DESCRIPTIVE models are harder, but can be done
	overfitting
	
- general solutions
	use a cross-validation [EXAMPLE HERE?]
	
- classification
	use accuracy, MCC, F1 [NO, BETTER EXAMPLE HERE]

- interpretability of the models

- hyperparameter optimization
	
- examples on "donn√©es fil rouge"
	descriptive model (just shown)
