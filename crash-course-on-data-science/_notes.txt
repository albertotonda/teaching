## Basic computer science
- instructions, variables, functions, objects: everything in memory
- idea: re-use the code as much as possible
- disadvantages: libraries are periodically updated

## Practical advice
- logging
- resuming crashed experiments
- storing random seed
- git and version control
- structure git repositories: src/ data/ scripts/ requirements.txt README.md /local

## Machine learning
- cross-validation
- how do the algorithms work?
