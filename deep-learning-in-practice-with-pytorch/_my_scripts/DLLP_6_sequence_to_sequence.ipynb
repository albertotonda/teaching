In the code below, you might have noticed that I created two optimizers, one for the encoder and one for the decoder. As the gradients on the tensors representing the parameters of each are computed in the same backward pass, in theory we could use just one optimizer. However, I had some trouble passing the parameters of the two networks together to a single optimizer, so for the moment I used this patch. I am sure that if I created another wrapper class, that had inside both an instance of EncoderRNN and DecoderRNN, I would be able to do it, but I ran out of time to prepare this example, sorry ^_^;\n",
