# NOTES

Three parts:
- general introduction to optimization
	-- exact optimization (operation research)
	-- stochastic optimization 
- optimization as the engine of artificial intelligence
	-- machine learning
	-- symbolic manipulation (Monte-Carlo tree search and similia)
- optimization to improve artificial intelligence's performance
	-- hyperparameter optimization
	
Rewrite:
- optimization as artificial intelligence
- optimization as the engine of artificial intelligence
- optimization to improve performance of artificial intelligence

OPTIMIZATION AS AI?
	Introduce the notion of P or NP
	Can you discretize your search space and enumerate all possibilities? EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH
	Is your problem including only binary variables? SAT SOLVER
	Can you frame your problem as a linear problem, with linear constraints? SIMPLEX
	Does your problem have a relatively small number of variables? BRANCH AND BOUND, OTHER OPERATIONAL RESEARCH TECHNIQUES
	Is the search space of your problem convex (or more or less convex) and you can compute the gradient? STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT AND VARIANTS
	Convex, but you cannot compute the derivative? BRACKETING? Or HILL CLIMBER?
	Is your cost function relatively inexpensive to compute and informative? EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS
	Is your cost function informative, but extremely computationally heavy? BAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION
	
	Also, CONFLICTING OBJECTIVES?
	Also, GREEDY APPRAOCHES? HILL CLIMBERS?
	Also, PERMUTATION? CONCORDE?
	Also, SURROGATE MODELS?
	Also, MULTI-MODAL EVALUATION USING "SALTO" TECHNIQUE?
