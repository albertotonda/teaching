# NOTES

Two parts:
- general introduction to optimization
	-- exact optimization (operation research)
	-- stochastic optimization 
- optimization as the engine of artificial intelligence
	-- machine learning
	-- symbolic manipulation (Monte-Carlo tree search and similia)
- optimization to improve artificial intelligence's performance
	-- hyperparameter optimization
	
Rewrite:
- optimization as artificial intelligence
- optimization as the engine of artificial intelligence
- optimization to improve performance of artificial intelligence
